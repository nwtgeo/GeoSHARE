					<p>This page is meant as a singular landing page for sharing resources, links and best practise
						recommendations to GNWTs GIS user community who wish to play in our organizational
						cloud mapping platform. May it provide you with rich resources and lead to our collective
						success in the realm of web mapping development.</p>


					<h2>The ESRI Cloud</h2>
					<a href="https://nwtgeomatics.maps.arcgis.com/" target="_blank"><span class="image left"><img
								src="images/AGOL_Org_Homepage.JPG" width="50%" /></span></a>

					<p><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS Online (AGOL)</a> is the ESRI cloud platform. It offers
						users with a robust framework to publish/host geospatial content, integrate web resources,
						develop applications, and share/distribute these resources within an organization or with the
						general public. </p>

					<p>The <a href="http://www.geomatics.gov.nt.ca/">NWT Centre for Geomatics (NWTCG)</a> has
						established an organizational account for use throughout the community of GIS users within the
						GNWT. </p>

					<p>Our organizational homepage is accessible (with account credentials) at :</p>

					<ul class="actions">
						<li><a href="https://nwtgeomatics.maps.arcgis.com/"
								class="button primary icon solid fa-home">NWTCG AGOL HOME PAGE</a></li>
					</ul>

					<hr>

					<h2>Accounts:</h2>
					<p>Access to our organizational ArcGIS Online (AGOL) account is via unique user accounts. You can
						request an AGOL organizational account by contacting the Centre for Geomatics (NWTCG) @ <a
							href="mailto:geonwt@gov.nt.ca?subject=AGOL account request">geonwt@gov.nt.ca</a>. You will
						receive an email
						invitation which will allow you to create a new account (user name and password) and join
						our organization in AGOL. Be sure to record these account credentials for future
						reference/use as all the content in our AGOL organizational account requires these
						credentials to access and engage with.</p>
					<hr>

					<h2>Roles & Permissions:</h2>
					<p>There are a number of different roles and permissions assigned to all NWTCG AGOL accounts. All
						new users will, by default, be assigned a <b>Limited Publisher</b> role unless other
						requirements are
						specified. The Limited Publisher role allows users to create, publish (web enable GIS data), and
						build geo content in AGOL but it <u>does not permit sharing of this content publicly</u>. By
						default then, all content built/created in AGOL will only be accessible within our organization
						initially.</p>
					<p>
						If users wish to integrate their AGOL content into webpages or share more broadly with public,
						contact NWTCG to review and approve this content for more broad sharing and public
						accessibility.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Credits:</h2>
					<p>AGOL charges usage (processing and storage) based on a pre-existing <a
							href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/credits.htm">credit consumption
							schematic</a>.
						All NWTCG AGOL users are capped to <b>25 credits</b>. This amount is sufficient to get going,
						create
						web maps, publish new services, &/or develop applications. If you find you’re constrained by the
						default credit cap contact the NWTCG to discuss.</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Resources:</h2>
					<p>ESRI has many great resources available to get you rolling with mapping and exploring in AGOL.
						Here is a list of recommended lessons, resources and good intro material:</p>
					<li><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/online-quick-exercises.htm">AGOL
							quick lessons</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/get-started-with-maps.htm">Make a
							map</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/change-style.htm">Style a map</a>
					</li>
					<li><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/get-started/view-maps.htm">Configure a map</a>
					</li>
					<li><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/share-items.htm">Redistribute/Share
							a map</a></li><br>
					<p>These are just <b>some</b> of the many resources ESRI makes available through its online training
						material. Your AGOL account will also allow you to tap into the many ESRI training resources
						online at <a href="https://www.esri.com/training/">https://www.esri.com/training/</a></p>
					<p>Additional AGOL
						information and material is available at <a
							href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/resources">https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/resources</a>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Content Management:</h2>
					<p>The following are <b>best practise recommendations</b> to consider efficient and good file
						management of content in AGOL:</p>
					<h3>FOLDERS:</h3>
					<p>Users should consider the use of personal folders within their own content to store related
						resources within a singular folder. Here’s Joseph (accompanied by some soft background harp
						music) to show you how to set up user folders in AGOL: <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YQr4A3GPsU">
							https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YQr4A3GPsU</a>
					</p>
					<h3>GROUPS:</h3>
					<p>Groups are a way to extend the concept of user folders (above) and create multi-user sharing and
						collaboration workspaces/directories of specific/tailored content. Members can be invited to
						join a group and specific permissions to group content can be managed by the group owner or an
						AGOL administrator. Here’s how to create/use AGOL groups: <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPV5C0eWAgw">
							https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPV5C0eWAgw</a></p>

					<span class="image Centre"><img src="images/AGOL_Components.jpg" width="80%" /></span>



					<h3>FILE NAMES:</h3>
					<p>Use simple, obvious naming conventions for all your content. A group share containing the
						following named content will be much more readily understood than some cryptic clutter of
						nonsensical whimsy.</p>
					<p> Consider, in this regard, the fact that core components of AGOL materials can be sourced to
						three primary components <i>(as shown in above image)</i>:
						<ol>
							<b>
								<li>GIS Content</li>
							</b>
							<b>
								<li>Web Map</li>
							</b>
							<b>
								<li>Web App</li>
							</b>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<h3>CATEGORIES:</h3>
					<p>Utilizing content categorization is another useful way in which all AGOL content (features, web
						maps, web apps, etc.) can be organized, searched, shared and made easily discoverable. You
						should tag your content with project categories using the steps outlined by Kelly here:
						<a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbDjHJdcMBs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbDjHJdcMBs</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						*** Note that categories exist in two places: the organization (as a whole) and within groups
						(categories are unique by groups). Contact an AGOL Administrator or email <a
							href="mailto:geonwt@gov.nt.ca?subject=AGOL category request">geonwt@gov.nt.ca</a> for
						assistance with category creation or amendments.
					</p>

					<h3>TAGGING:</h3>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/AGOL_TaggedContent.png" /></span>
					<p>Tagging AGOL content with keywords or singular text descriptors is a good practise for all
						material because it allows for quick and easy search functionality PLUS it’s another great way
						to consider organizing and recording all the content within an organizational AGOL platform.
						Tagging content is as simple as finding the Tags side panel on the item description page (@
						bottom right) and hitting the Edit button to add new tags or amend existing ones. </p>
					<p>You will only be able to tag the content you own or have been given edit permissions to (through
						a group share)</p>

					<h3>ITEM DESCRIPTION:</h3>
					<p>Adding any/all relevant information and item description to your content is another way to ensure
						successful project hand-off and ease of use to all other organizational users. Consider item
						description a high level metadata entry option with the added bonus of styling this content and
						embedding hyperlinks or URLs as complimentary pieces of information.</p>




					<p>These are just some of the recommended best practise to content management in AGOL.</p>
					<p>
						Content within an organizational AGOL platform can get overwhelming in volume in little time
						thus considering the above best practises and instituting on these recommendations is critical
						to long term success and content management at the organizational level.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Building with Existing Resources:</h2>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/AGOL_GNWT_WMS.JPG" /></span>
					<p>In order to reduce the bulk of content hosted on AGOL and minimize on credit consumption,
						wherever possible, users should tap into and utilize the NWTCG existing web mapping libraries
						via our <a href="https://www.apps.geomatics.gov.nt.ca/arcgis/rest/services/GNWT">production
							server</a>.</p>
					<p>
						Here, users can integrate and consume our public web map services (WMS) that are shared via an
						ISO categorization.</p>
					<p>Here’s a <a
							href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/add-layers.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_A82A515232CB4672838FEB9FCF8E76D8">step-by-step
							guide</a> to integrating existing WMS in an AGOL web map.</p>
					<p>
						Utilizing from the NWTCG WMS library will ensure the information you are integrating is always
						current and maintained by the appropriate department. Further, it will reduce the possibility of
						publishing redundant/duplicate data that will consume additional credits while simultaneously
						requiring update cycles and processes.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Additional Resources:</h2>
					<h3>ArcGIS PRO</h3>
					<p>Access and licensing for ArcGIS Pro is tethered to AGOL organizational accounts. Download and
						install ArcGIS Pro <a
							href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/install-and-sign-in-to-arcgis-pro.htm">HERE</a>
						and then authenticate and authorize usage of this software using your AGOL account credentials.
						<br><br>If you wish to use ArcGIS Pro contact <a
							href="mailto:geonwt@gov.nt.ca?subject=ArcGIS PRO request">geonwt@gov.nt.ca</a> to arrange
						for this provision.
					</p>
					<h3>Geomatics User Meeting (GUM) Group</h3>
					<p>The NWTCG coordinates a large working group of GIS users within the GNWT fondly known as the GUM
						group. This group meets quarterly (or thereabouts) to share common topics and geo related
						projects and technologies. Contact NWTCG to be including in future communications from this
						group.</p>
					<h3>ESRI Training</h3>
					<p>Access all the many online learning tools from ESRI via <a
							href="https://www.esri.com/training/">https://www.esri.com/training/</a>.<br>
						Log in here with your AGOL account and you will have access to the full slate of training
						materials.
					</p>
					<h3>GeoNet</h3>
					<p>Join the GeoNet community and ask questions or research technical content via
						<a href="https://community.esri.com/">https://community.esri.com/</a>. Again, you can use your
						AGOL account to log in to GeoNet and
						explore the wealth of resources there.</p>
